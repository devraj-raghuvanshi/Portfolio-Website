    title: "Attention-Aware Deep Architecture for Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection",
    description:
    " We're utilizing the MUStARD++ dataset, a multimodal video corpus, for automated sarcasm detection. Our approach involves integrating state-of-the-art models for textual, visual, and acoustic features. The results so far are promising, with a notable 3.96% improvement in the weighted F1-score compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our current efforts are dedicated to improving the collaborative gating mechanism for multi-modal feature fusion, to further elevate the project's effectiveness.",

    title: "Semantic Comprehension Framework For Memes Using Cross-Modal Relational and Heirarchical Attention",
    description:
    "This project involved employing few-shot prompting with GPT-3.5 for text augmentation. Additionally, GraphSAGE, a Graph Neural Network, was leveraged for cross-modal relation learning, complemented by a carefully designed hierarchical attention mechanism for effective multi-task learning. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated on three datasets: Memotion1.0, MultiOFF, and MMHS150k. Impressively, our approach outperformed previous state-of-the-art models across various metrics, achieving notable improvements in sentiment analysis (3.14%), offensiveness detection (2.06%), motivation detection (1.86%), humor detection (1.39%), and sarcasm detection (0.64%). Our work has been submitted to ",

    title: "Deep Learning-Based Query-Response System for Agricultural Decision-Making",
    description:
    "An LSTM-based architecture was designed to build a query-response framework for the agriculture sector. A novel clustering method, significantly more time-efficient than traditional approaches, was proposed, along with an innovative answer retrieval methodology to obtain the most relevant responses for farmers' queries. The achieved results were notable, with a 96.58% weighted F1-score for query mapping and a 96.2% NDCG score for answer retrieval. A total of 68 experiments were conducted, utilizing datasets from five Indian states. This research has been published in ",
