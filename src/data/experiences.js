      "I worked in a team to develop a multimodal framework to perform semantic comprehension of memes, specifically detecting sentiment and emotion. My responsibilities covered everything from brainstorming and designing the approach to coding, digging into the details, and writing up our findings. I also worked on a practical project building a system to help farmers make decisions, using deep learning models like LSTM to analyze data from the Kisan Call Center (KCC) dataset. It was a hands-on experience that allowed me to apply my skills in a real-world context.",
